                                <p>We suggest shilling this coin heavily to anyone who has the right sense of humor to throw cryptocurrency into a pit of fuckery; or anyone who genuinely believes <strike>bitconnect</strike> dividends are a good idea. Creating posts on how this coin is like a standard crypto on crack with price swings and meme payouts, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/">/r/wallstreetbets</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/">/r/cryptocurrency</a>, <a href="http://boards.4chan.org/biz/">/biz/</a>, and making several youtube videos promoting POWHcrab16 is also encouraged. Please do not lie or guarantee gains, this is a game and should be considered as such!</p>

                                <h5>Step 3: HODL</h5>
                                <p>Everytime 1 token is sold, the Smart Contract will increase the price of every token and pays out dividends. With the dynamic pricing it's likely the coin will crash, induce FOMO (fear of missing out) and trigger an entire new-wave of buyins and dividends for all previous holders. Someone is losing money, don't let it be you!</p>

If you've HODLed for long enough and shilled hard enough that enough people have chased the meme after you, your gains will be through the roof!</p>

        <h3 class="section-title text-center m-5">FAQ</h3>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="py-4">
                <p><b>Q: Is this a real thing?</b></p>
                <p>A: Yes.</p>
                <p><b>Q: Who Made This?</b></p>
                <p>A: We dare not speak their name.<p>
                <p><b>Q: Wasn't there something similar to this earlier?</b></p>
                <p>A: As in, 15 minutes ago? Yes. You're thinking of POWHcoin, POWHcoin3, and whatever POWHcoin has been made since then. We're the exact same thing, only this time you get to be at ground zero. And this project is Bog endorsed.</p>
                <p><b>Q: How do we know you guys won't do the same thing? </p></b>
                <p>A: Are you drunk? We just told you we're doing the same thing.<p>
                <p><b>How does this work? Can I actually cash out?</b></p>
                <p>A: You cannot cash out.</p>
                <p><b>Q: Can I actually make ETH off of this?</b></p>
                <p>A: Yes! I would rather you assume you won't though.</p>
                <p><b>Q: What do I need to buy into this Ponzi Scheme?</b></p>
                <p>A: You need to install <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a> and also need to buy some Ether (ETH), probably from something like Coinbase.</p>
                <p><b>Q: This seems like a great investment opportunity! I need to get back all the money I lost in BitConnect, so can I put my entire pension fund/college fund/retirement savings/second home mortgage in?</b>
                <p>A: No, this is a joke foremost and secondarily a toy that only has as much value as the fun you get out of it (and the fun you get out of other players).</p>
                <p><b>Q: Is this a scam?</b></p>
                <p>A: Yes, More accurately this is a game where you put cryptocurrency into trying to trick, fake out, or scam everyone else out of their cryptocurrency. Any value you deposit into this smart contract should purely be placed because you enjoy the concept and social experiment and wish to participate. For better or worse. </p>
                <p><b>Q: Is this site secure?</b></p>
                <p>A: All transactions are handled through the Ethereum network, Metamask and Our insane blockchain gambling smart-contract. Do not use this site if you do not trust these systems. Our bet is on Metamask taking your money.</p>
                <p><b>Q: This seems to be too good to be true, how am I getting screwed?</b></p>
                <p>A: It's a literal pyramid scheme on a rollercoaster. The price can fluccuate upwards and downwards extremely quickly depending on who cashes in/out of the contract. The dividends design encourages more and more players to hold over longer periods of time and should naturally push the price upwards however. </p>
                <p><b>Q: Are there any other coins that pay dividends like this?</b></p>
                <p>A: Yeah lots actually, <a href="https://powhcoin.com">POWHcoin</a>and <a href="https://powncoin3.com">POWNcoin3</a> are big name ponzi tokens that pay out a percentage of all coins bought on the platform.</p>
                <p><b>Q: Is this coin pre-mined?</b></p>
                <p>A: Nope, but the Bogs will buy their share.</p>
                <p><b>Q: So this won't suddenly dissapear overnight with everything i put in it?</b></p>
                <p>A: The Smart-Contract will not vanish, the website can have anything happen to it at any time which may affect your ability to withdraw or manage your coins through the GUI interface it provides. On the Purchasing page we plan to provide a handy guide of how you can withdraw dividends and tokens without the GUI; so you can save a copy locally.  </p>
